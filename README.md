# Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) Tensorflow 2 implementation

This repo is offering a perfect example for implementing WAGN-GP using Tensorflow 2.0. The code should be compatible with tf 2.2.0 or future versions.
The script is easy to follow for the beginners since I did not use complicated python structures.
